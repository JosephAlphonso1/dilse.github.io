<h1 style="color:DarkBlue;">DIL SE STIGMA STUDY</h1>
<h4 style="font-family:'verdana'"> Every once in a while, usually in the midst of a particularly stressful period of time, I catch myself scoffing at the idea of therapy. Whether it's mentioned when a friend is catching me up on what they have been up to since I last saw them, a scene in a movie or something in the media. This pattern of behavior is most concerning when I remember that I am a director of the South Asian organization, Dil Se at the University of Michigan, which was created in opposition to cultural stigmas regarding mental health care in the South Asian diaspora. Upon this realization, I wanted to take a closer look at the perceptions of therapy among Asian students at the University of Michigan more broadly, to see if my own personal behaviors were a microcosm of a larger cultural phenomenon. </h4>
<h4 style="font-family:'verdana'"> Data on Asian Americans is often not stratified to include information regarding gender, religion, region of Asia and sexual orientation, which is problematic for Asian Americans, a racial categorization that holds immense diversity. Statistics of Asian American mental health in general is quite limited, especially data that is stratified to grasp the intense diversity that exists among this demographic. The Dil Se Stigma Study was conducted with the intention of making a dent in answering questions within the context of the University of Michigan undergraduate community such as: Are Asian American women more likely to believe in the benefits of therapy than Asian American men? Are there more South Asians who know of family members going to therapy than Southeast Asians? And many, many more.</h4>
